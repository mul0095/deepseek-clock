See when DeepSeek is half price without checking the clock yourself.
Click the menu bar icon for current Flash and V4 Pro rates, a countdown to the next price change, and the time it happens in your timezone.

Native macOS app.
No account or backend needed.

## Pricing schedule

- Peak: Monday-Friday, 01:00-04:00 and 06:00-10:00 UTC.
- Off-peak: all other times, at half price.

Times are shown in your Mac's local timezone.
The app works out pricing locally using the rates in `Sources/DeepSeekClock/DeepSeekPricing.swift`.
